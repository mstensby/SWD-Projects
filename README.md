# Welcome to my Software Design Repository

During the course of this semester, we focused on advanced topics of Java such as extensive JUnit Testing, Polymorphism, Multithreading, Networking, and much more. 

I had a great experience during this class, and found that all of the topics we discussed in this class are used in every day programming for video games, websites, and databases.
