# Welcome to my Software Design Repository

Welcome! My name is Matt Stensby, and I am a Computer Science and Engineering Major at the University of Iowa. 
During the course of my Junior semester, I took a class called "Software Design" where we focused on advanced topics of Java such as extensive JUnit Testing, Polymorphism, Multithreading, Networking, and even greedy algorithms.

I had a great experience during this class, and enjoy knowing that all of the topics we discussed in this class are used in every day programming for video games, websites, and databases.

Please do not hesistate to reach out to stensbymatt@gmail.com with any questions!
